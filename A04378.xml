            <title>The height of Israels heathenish idolatrie, in sacrificing their children to the Deuill diuided into three sections: where is shewed in the first, the growth and degrees of this, and generally of other sinnes and idolatries. In the second, that the Deuill was the god of the heathen; with the meanes by which he obtayned that honour. With a large application to our times, against popery, shewing the pride thereof, and malice both against soule and body; together with the meanes, sleights, and policies by which it seduceth, killeth, and in the person of the Pope, raiseth it selfe to its present height. In the third, the blinde zeale of idolaters. Deliuered generally in two sermons preached at S. Maries in Cambridge: the first whereof is much inlarged: by Robert Ienison Bachelor of Diuinitie, and late Fellow of S. Johns Colledge in Cambridge.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:8129:3"/>This is the cauſe why I haue prefixed your names to the greateſt part of this enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; which, for the publike good and yours, I thought good, as my weekely paines would giue leaue, to publiſh as an Argument, if not ſo plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly penned for the manner, yet at the leaſt, more ſtrange and vnuſuall (yet not vnprofitable) for the matter.

Euen thus is it among men, Chriſtians eſpecially, who (of all other ſorts of men) haue the leaſt intereſt in themſelues, ſo liuing (when they liue as they ſhould) as giuen to others, lent onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8129:12"/>
thankfully throughout this Pſalme his continued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued mercies in their many deliuerances. Secondly, they yeeld him the praiſe of his <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> acknowledging the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it from time to time in their manifold afflictions and ſcourgings; but eſpecially in this their laſt and greateſt, which was their diſperſion among the heathen. Thirdly, here is alſo an humble <hi>confeſſion</hi> of their ſins, with the ſins of their forefathers; which daily increaſing more and more, cauſed theſe iudgements of God, and now being growne to an height, haue brought vpon them this great captiuity.</p>
                     <p>All which three, Mercies, Iudgements Sinnes, are in this Pſalme interchangeably and intermixedly mentioned, to ſignifie the inſeparable connexion betweene ſinne and puniſhment, and yet the ſweet mixture of Gods mercy with his iuſtice. Each againe either amplifying, aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or iuſtifying another, and all of them conſpiring to ſet forth the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, their ſinnes iuſtifie his iudgements, and amplifie his mercies, ſo that he muſt needs be acknowledged both iuſt in puniſhing, and mercifull in remitting. Secondly, his iudgements doe condemne their ſinnes, and commend his mercies: for God neuer ſtrikes without iuſt cauſe in vs, and therefore neuer remoues the Rod but of meere mercy in himſelfe. Thirdly, Gods mercies and many deliueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe aggrauate their ſinnes, and iuſtifie his iudgements; for, to ſinne againe after mercy is once ſhewed, doubles the fault, and ſtops the mouth of the faulty for complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of after iudgements.</p>
                     <p>To leaue the reſt, let vs take a view and conſideration of their ſinnes, as my Text occaſions vs. And firſt, the firſt word <hi>Yea</hi> bids vs looke backe, or rather downe to number the ſteps and ſtayres by which ſinne hath mounted to this height,<note place="margin">The ſteps and growth of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els ſinnes.</note> and aſcended this Tower of Babell.

whereby the Children exceed the Fathers in wickedneſſe, till their ſinnes come to an height, fulneſſe and ripeneſſe, as did the ſins of the Amorites after more then 400.<note place="margin">Gen. 15.16.</note> yeares growth; and of theſe Iſraelites from the time of their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in Aegypt till their bondage in Babylon.

This reſemblance I follow the rather, becauſe it is vſed by S. <hi>Iames, ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 14.15. and Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.4.5.

Now that which will follow vpon all theſe, is, that one ſinne perfited, will draw on and make way for other greater ſinnes, ſo that without repentance, men ſhall proceed from euill to worſe, till at the length, they be tied and bound in infinite chaines, and therein kept for the day of deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Oh therefore that men out of the former conſiderations, would but lay to heart this myſticall working of ſinne, that with feare they might either watch againſt the firſt motions of ſinne, or with ſpeedy repentance but winde themſelues out of the ſnares of the Deuill, as knowing that otherwiſe God will one day wound the hairy ſcalpe of him that goeth on in his ſinne.</p>

ſeuen bodies of each ſexe to appeaſe the wrath of god.

                     <p>Thirdly and chiefly, God (that he might be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the only true God, and worſhipped according to his owne minde and will) hath made his power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head knowne, and alſo reuealed his will to ſuch as his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decree hath made choice of, whom he would binde to himſelfe by true religion, and by performance of duties inioyned in both Tables, and that both with externall and internall worſhip. To this end he made a Couenant with his people the Iewes (which for ſubſtance he continues ſtill with vs) wherein on his part he firſt makes himſelfe knowne by many free promiſes and profers of diuers bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, grace, mercy, deliuerances, and life it ſelfe: and this he doth and confirmes vnto vs in his word and Sacraments. Secondly, he requires and lookes for ſomething from vs. Therefore on our part he requireth firſt, that by <hi>faith</hi> we beleeue what he promiſeth, and receiue what he offers; which we doe in the word and Sacraments: Secondly, that by obedience inward and outward we both promiſe and performe what he requires in his lawes both morall and ceremoniall, by giuing him the inward ſacrifice of the heart, as alſo outward oblations and ſacrifices, and by the celebration of Feaſts by way of thankfulneſſe to him.</p>

                     <p>Theſe things granted: we further preſuppoſe, the ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties and ſleights of Satan, that he is able (by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which we alſo preſuppoſe, as without which he can doe nothing) to ſeduce and miſlead mans ignorance, to the acknowledging and worſhipping of falſe gods, and of himſelfe. Further, that as by his ſuttletie he <hi>can</hi> doe this, ſo his pride againſt God and malice againſt vs is ſuch, that hee will doe it, and which indeed hee doth accordingly.

                     <p>Secondly, their ſupernaturall knowledge is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſcured, for they are ignorant of very many things, which if they had not falne they ſhould haue knowne: yet is it not quite none, ſeeing we read in Scripture that they knew and confeſſed Chriſt to be the Sonne of God, and that he was come to diſſolue their wicked workes, to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; to condemne them; that the Apoſtles were the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the moſt high God, and conſequently that Chriſt was the moſt high God, whoſe ſeruants the Apoſtles were. But becauſe ſuch knowledge of Chriſt and of the Goſpell, though fruitleſſe and dead, cannot proceed from fleſh and blood, but onely from diuine reuelation, either by good Angels, or by the effects of Gods power and prouidence, manifeſted to them, therefore we ceaſe further to ſpeake of it till we come to the third branch of their knowledge, which wee obſerued and called attained, or new know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>Now laſtly, for ſauing knowledge ioyned with loue and confidence in God, they haue no part at all in it, though no doubt but the good Angels haue it both much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and moſt ſtrongly and immutably confirmed in them. And this was the ſhrewdeſt and foreſt blow of all the reſt, whereby they were depriued of this ſauing and true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe they abode not in the truth.</p>
                     <p>But yet, you may ſay, this lets nor but that their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may be ſufficient enough to foreſee ſuch things as Oracles haue foretold, and which farre ſurpaſſe the reach of mans foreſight. Therefore let vs conſider theſe two
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8129:27"/>
points, which are very pertinent. The firſt is, what things they can certainly know and foretell, and what not. The ſecond more particular, whether and how farre forth they knew the ſecret thoughts and affections of mans heart.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">1. Whether Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know and foretell future contingents.</note> we muſt briefly know that things to come may be knowne two wayes, either in themſelues, or in their cauſes and ſignes. In themſelues, when things not yet exiſting are as certainely foreſeene as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and laid open in our ſight: which is done either by the proper motion and ſpirit of the foreſeer, and this is Gods property alone; or by inſpiration from God, and ſo Gods Prophets both ſaw many things in themſelues by illumination from God, and alſo told them before they were. In their cauſes are future things foreſeene, when by the viewing and beholding of their cauſes, we gather that ſuch or ſuch effects will follow. Now becauſe effects flow from their cauſes either neceſſarily, the cauſes being ſuch as cannot be hindred, as is the eclipſe of the Sun or Moone; or, though not of meere neceſſity, nor of meere chance, yet for the moſt part and moſt commonly they follow their cauſes, which yet may ſometimes be hindered in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as ſeed ſowne, by diuers occaſions is hindered that it doth not alwayes ſprout out, ſpindle and become corne: or laſtly, wholly caſually and contingently, their cauſes being altogether indeterminate and indifferent. Hence it is that Satan and his inſtruments may certainely know the firſt kind of effects, which euen men can certainely ſee and foretell. And for the ſecond kind, howſoeuer men cannot certainely, but onely coniecturally and probably foreſee the euents of things; yet Satan may, at the leaſt more certainely then men, foreſee them, as more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely knowing the nature of their cauſes, and whether or no there be any impediment which may hinder their actual exiſtence; yet becauſe ſuch impediments often are ſent from God immediately, whoſe ſecret will they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, hence wee alſo ſafely conclude, that euen ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects cannot infallibly bee knowne by the Deuill before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, for God hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Iſay. 44.25.</note> 
                        <hi>I deſtroy the tokens of the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8129:28"/>
and make them that coniecture fooles.</hi> But concerning the third and laſt kind, where the queſtion is, whether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils know things meerely contingent or no, without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reuelation, as that <hi>Iudas</hi> was to betray Chriſt, and the like; I anſwer, that to know ſuch things certainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs onely to the true Iehouah, and cannot bee knowne preciſely either by man or Angell, good or bad, vnleſſe God reueale the ſame. As for example, to know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand the time and kind of a mans death, is contingent, of which the good Angell profeſſeth himſelfe to be ignorant when he was asked by <hi>Eſdras</hi> concerning that mattter.<note place="margin">

                        </note> So likewiſe many things were to befall the Church after Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time, which the Angell could not foretell but by reuelation from Chriſt, yea Chriſt himſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed ſuch things onely to <hi>Iohn,</hi> which hee as man, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from his Father and from his owne diuinity. Much leſſe then can any wicked ſpirit naturally foreknow any ſuch contingent effect, howſoeuer they may coniecture better of theſe things then we men. Therefore, ſeeing we ſpeake not of a coniecturall but of a certaine and infallible knowledge of future contingents, wee conclude that no ſuch thing can bee foreknowne or foretold by deuils cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely without reuelation.</p>

may know the inclination and affection of another mans heart, and therefore much rather the Deuill.

For of old they know that ſuch proceedings, and ſuch affections in men, of pride, vaine-glory, emulation, wrath, and head-long impatience, will haue anſwerable and ſutable euents, and the ſame ends which formerly and in other men of like affections they haue had.</p>
                     <p>Now to make their prediction of any ſuch thing more certaine; when God permits, they by temptations and continuall perſwaſions ceaſe not to prouoke men to put in practiſe and execution ſome wicked thought or other. Thus was he bent and forward enough to ſtirre vp the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> to ſpoile <hi>Iob</hi> of his ſubſtance. And thus eſpecially he intermeddles with matters of State, ſo that he may preſume to foretell ſuch things as himſelfe for the greateſt part is the author of. And yet that agilitie whereby almoſt in a moment he can be preſent in moſt places, is a helpe to him herein; for thus when he ſees things a practiſing or already effected in one place, he can ſpeedily in another ſhew them to his prophets as things to come. And thus he foretold to his prophets in <hi>Noua Francia,</hi> the comming of the <hi>French,</hi> long before they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached.</p>

Heretofore indeed he by Oracle publikely commanded the killing of men, and was obeyed; but God be thanked, our Sauiour Chriſt by his comming hath put him to ſilence in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: yet now he teacheth the ſame leſſon, and is alſo obeyed in this, as in many things elſe. For we know there are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of deuils, whereof theſe laſt times are in danger, and there are Doctors of deuils, which ſay they are Chriſtians, and Ieſus his diſciples, calling themſelues <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> yet are they not, but the Synagogue of Satan. Theſe are they by whom eſpecially Satan exerciſeth his malice, both againſt mens ſoules by ſeducing, and their bodies by killing them: by both Satan goes about ſeeking whom he may deuoure, and that not only in his owne perſon, but in the perſon of his inſtruments, eſpecially <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and generally the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faction. Theſe ſeeke firſt to ſeduce, and where they ſpeed not ſo, they proceed to the ſecond.

And here we may obſerue the rage and zeale of the wicked, which is not zealous enough vnleſſe it end in blood.

But ſuch were Satans policies among the Heathen: for, all his farre ſhewes, and transformations, and apiſh imitations of God, and his dealings with his Church, whither tended they? <hi>Firſt,</hi> to the hurt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; which hurt was intended <hi>firſt</hi> and chiefly againſt the ſoule, which thus he laboured to ſeduce by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from the ſeruice of God to the ſeruice of himſelfe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> alſo againſt the body, ouer which he did cruelly tyrannize, by being blindly obeyed of men in voluntary ſelfe-ſacrifices.</p>

For as formerly they more directly ſet vpon the vnderſtanding with Paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes and other deluſions; ſo they would alſo wooe the Miſtris by the Maid, they would deceiue <hi>Adam</hi> by his wife <hi>Eue,</hi> and with the Philiſtims, politickely get and hire <hi>Dalilah</hi> to lull <hi>Sampſon</hi> aſleepe that he might be taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue; that is, by the affections and outward ſenſes of the body they ſeeke to corrupt and blind, yea to captiuate and bind the iudgement.

                        <note place="margin">Which is done</note> But particularly the popiſh practiſe herein and imitation of their father appeares in their, firſt, abuſing; ſecondly, polluting; thirdly, pleaſing the affections and ſenſes of men.</p>

their kindred, fathers and forefathers? for hereon they ground a moſt peſtilent perſwaſion to entertaine the loue of their errors for and with the loue of their perſons. What ſay they, do you thinke that all your forefathers who liued and died in popery, are damned? haue ye not more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table conceits of them then ſo? if then you haue, why doe you not follow their ſteps? Thus haue ſome Popiſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents vpon their death-bed, charged their childrens loue with an obedience to their laſt command, which was, that they ſhould alſo liue and die in the ſame religion, and this is the chiefe reaſon which ſome of them can giue of their faith, as in experience I haue found.</p>
                     <p>Thus alſo, he is no Gentleman that is no Papiſt, whereas God knowes, men, how noble ſoeuer, neuer ceaſe to bee Gentlemen in Gods account till then: for then indeed doe they ceaſe alſo to be men<note n="*" place="margin">See Lactant.

                     <p>Vpon the like ground, when they finde any vntractable through too much prejudice, they labour to temper him with their plauſible conuerſation, winding themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to credit, reputation, loue, &amp;c. thus to gaine ſome intereſt and poſſeſſion in the hearts and affections of ſuch as they would ſeduce.

Euen thus, ſaith a worthy Obſeruer,<note place="margin">D. <hi>Hall</hi> in his <hi>Quo vadis?</hi> Sect. 16.</note> haue wee ſeene an Hawke caſt off at an Heron-ſhaw, to looke and flye a quite other way, and after many careleſſe and ouerly fetches, to towre vp vnto the prey intended. All this is, that at leaſt for loue of their perſons, the poyſon of their after-perſwaſions may be loued, taken and digeſted. For now hauing got them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the reputation of a ſweet ingenuitie, and delightfull ſociableneſſe, opportunitie is found to beſtow ſome witty ſcoffes vpon thoſe parts of our Religion which lye moſt open to aduantage, and ſo from them with many proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

                     <p>It is obſerued by ſome, that ſo many bookes of bawdry and ribaldry, as are by Popiſh factors of purpoſe tranſlated out of Italian into Engliſh, doe turne more from the truth at home, then their contentious bookes abroad.

Here wee ſhall find a play-fellow for euery ſenſe, Church-muſicke for the eare, fine pictures and glorious ſhewes for the eyes, and ſo forth.

Loues any man eaſe and belly-cheare? this may be hoped for, if turning popiſh, he can get into the Popes kitchin, into an Abbay or Priorie, or ſuch other place which is richly indued with lands and reuenues. But if any ſhall rather like to liue as a Beggar, hee hath foure
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8129:68"/>
orders of begging Friars to ioyne himſelfe vnto (where yet vnder colour of being poore, hee may poſſeſſe all things) If you affect ſolitarineſſe, you haue the Hermites; if to keepe company, the conuentuall Monkes: if you bee deſirous of knowledge, you haue the Ieſuites that profeſſe it; if of ignorance, you haue the ignorant Friars which haue made a vertue of ignorance. Doth auſterity and ſhew of mortification like any man? at Rome you haue couents of cloiſtered Monkes wonderfull for their auſterity; if laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and reuelling, you haue the common Stewes hard by; on the one ſide of the ſtreet, a cloiſter of Virgins, on the other, a ſtie of Curtezans with publike permiſſion. And thus, in effect, are theſe varieties of recreations, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and profeſſions, (which all of purpoſe are ſo ſorted to rauiſh all mens affections, and to fit and pleaſe each hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour) decyphered by a worthy writer of our times,<note place="margin">Peter du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.

Their religious orders are made to ſerue for this purpoſe, among others.

taking his aduantage from mens naturall corruption and inclinations) according to mens humours and affections: which being obſerued by the diſciples of Satan, is more purpoſely made vſe of, that each inclination and humour might receiue content in Popery. And herein their policy paſſeth, for whereas in the former inſtances, religion dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated onely, or chiefly, according to the particular incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of each country and nation, it is otherwiſe in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, which is compacted of infinite contrarieties, all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to entertaine the ſeuerall humours of men, that ſo finding what may pleaſe their owne priuate humours, they may like better of Popery which affords them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. For here is multitude of ceremonies for the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; high honour from the Cardinals hat and Popes triple crowne, for the ambitious and aſpiring; voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the diſſolute; knowledge, profeſſed by the Ieſuits, for the louers of it; prayer, for the deuout; workes of piety, for the charitable, and other like varieties formerly named.

                     <p>To theſe others might be added, which they cannot hide from the eyes and obſeruation of the wiſe; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this depth of Satan is bottomleſſe, as reaching to hell it ſelfe, we ceaſe to ſearch further into it, as hauing already beene drawne on further then at the firſt we intended.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the deuilliſh policies of ſuch as would <hi>ſeduce</hi> the ſoules of men from the truth of God, whereby yet, as they <hi>deceiue,</hi> ſo are they <hi>deceiued,</hi> being thoſe very <hi>deceiuers</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo long ſince hath warned vs of.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.13.</note> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, while they are playing their feates, you may, as it were, ſee Satan looking ouer their ſhoulders, ſetting them alſo, and heartning them on, and by them working his owne purpoſes: hee being the grand-deceiuer deceiues both, and laughes to ſee the deceiuer deceiued by himſelfe. Yet if you pleaſe to looke vp higher, you may ſee <hi>God</hi> the Great Maſter of this game and tragicke-comedy, who by his infinite wiſdome (being as it were the Poet) contriued,

                     <p>The Romane Empire therefore falling to ruine, partly by inward diſeaſes, but chiefly by ſundry irruptions of the Northren people; the Biſhops of Rome beganne to build on thoſe ruines, and to abuſe the abſence and weakneſſe of the Emperours, whom they expelled out of Italy by the armes of the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> and confined them to <hi>Greece.</hi>

Now this was no little policy in them: for the Popes did not loue to haue ſuch a ſtrong neighbour ſo neare, who might at his pleaſure chaſtiſe or depoſe them. Thus as formerly the Pope of Rome, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the place and Emperours reſidence at Rome, tooke aduantage of preferring himſelfe in ſpirituall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie before other Biſhops, ſo now by occaſion of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours abſence, hee gaines opportunitie to aduance himſelfe in temporall power aboue the Emperours themſelues.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>We heare and read of many ſtrange Miracles and Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Popery, on which it is, for many (if not moſt) chiefe points founded, and by which it ſtands Wee had once here in England, a <hi>holy maid of Kent, Elizabeth Barton,</hi> a <hi>Nunne,</hi> which by the deuice of certaine Monks and Friers could ſeeme only to be fed by Angels, ſtrangely to alter her countenance and other parts of her body, and ſo lying in a traunce, to ſpeake many things in commendation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, and particularly in diſallowance of King <hi>Henries</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce from the Lady <hi>Catharine.</hi> But the knauerie being found, it coſt them all their liues.

This <hi>Mary,</hi> ſaith he, our Lord Ieſus tooke to wife, often appearing to her, granting her many particular graces and fauours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſing and ſpeaking as familiarly with her, as euer God did with <hi>Moſes,</hi> he oftentimes being accompanied with <hi>He</hi> and <hi>She</hi> Saints. The Inſtructions drawne by that Frier from her Miracles and Viſions, were, That it is needfull to honour Images, That Saints in Paradiſe are Interceſſours for vs, That it is needfull to acknowledge the truth of the Sacrament of the Altar. The like fountaines of Miracles are opened in the houſes of our Lady of <hi>Lauretto</hi> (of which there is a ſpeciall booke written, and tranſlated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh) of <hi>Hales,</hi> of which <hi>Lipſius</hi> makes relation.</p>

                     <p>For the firſt, it might eaſily be ſhewed how that the end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of all popiſh miracles and viſions is to confirme, if not to teach &amp; eſtabliſh ſuch popiſh doctrines as haue no ground in the holy Scriptures. <hi>Purgatory,</hi> a maine prop of Popery, for which our aduerſaries themſelues confeſſe they haue no expreſſe Scripture, hath no better ground then viſions and apparitions of the dead. So is the <hi>Maſſe</hi> confirmed by many <hi>Miracles</hi> which the conſecrated Hoſt hath done. So <hi>Garnet</hi> a traitor, is now made a canonized Saint, by an artificiall face vpon a ſtraw taken vp (being firſt caſt downe) at the place of his execution. Thus their aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>Images,</hi> their making the bleſſed Virgin to haue beene wholly without ſinne, and ſo the Feaſt of her <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Conception,</hi> the making of her alſo <hi>more mercifull</hi> then Chriſt, &amp; many the like points of Popery, receiue ſtrength from viſions and dreames of their owne, the which might with eaſe very plentifully be ſhewed, but that I take, none of themſelues can or will deny it. I will content my ſelfe (hauing already exceeded the bounds which at the firſt I ſet to my ſelfe) to inſtance in their doctrine of <hi>Inuocation of Saints,</hi> which hauing no expreſſe teſtimony of Scripture, by their owne confeſſion, hath no better ground then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions

Here is an aduantage gotten from mans naturall but rude knowledge; now ſee how it is followed. Man naturally hath alſo ſome conſcience of ſinne, and ſome ſhame for it, and therefore ſees his miſery in regard of ſinne &amp; of death deſerued by it. This guilt lets him ſee the neceſſity, but not the meanes of expiation: yet hee ſees it poſſible, and the meanes thus farre that it muſt be made by bloud. Hee is loath to ſpend his owne, and therefore eaſily drawne on to ſhed the bloud of beaſts. Imputation of the fault to the ſacrifice, and of the ſacrifice and its death to the faulty, is in part acknowledged neceſſary. Yet hence is built an after-conſideration, in ſhew more wiſe, in iſſue more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Shall man ſinne, and is it equitie any elſe ſhould die? Hence ſacrifices of men became ſo frequent. But they were for the moſt part malefactors, and their death was before deſerued. Let then the innocent giue the ranſome for the nocent. And who more innocent then children? and if children, why not your owne and onely ones? Our deareſt, proper, and moſt precious things pleaſe God the beſt, and purchaſe greateſt fauour: let him haue them therefore.</p>
